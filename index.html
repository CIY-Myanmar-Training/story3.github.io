    <h1> The Lion and The Poor Slave</h1>
    <img src="story3.jpeg"><img>
    <p>There was once a slave who was treated cruelly by his master. One day, he couldn’t take it anymore and ran to the forest to escape. There, he chanced upon a lion who couldn’t walk because of the thorn in its paw. Although scared, the slave mustered his courage and took out the thorn in the lion’s paw. When the lion was finally free of the thorn, he ran into the forest and didn’t harm the slave.

        Sometime later, the slave was caught by his master along with some animals in the forest. The master then ordered the slave to be thrown into the lion’s den. When the slave saw the lion, he recognized it as the lion he helped in the forest. The slave was able to escape the den unharmed, and he freed all the other animals.</p>
